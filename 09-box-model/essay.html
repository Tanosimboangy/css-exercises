          1- A short essay on what the Box Model is
        </h2>
        <p>
          I am writing this essay to explain what box model is. The box model is a container that contains every element in css. It helps the user to displays the layout in different styles or complexities. There are two types of boxes. For block box, the box will extend itself to give 100% enough space for its contents. For that to happen, the box will break onto new line. This has to respect the height and the width properties. However, the margin, the padding and the border control the limitation of the elements which fit inside the box and push away other elements which don't fit inside. Whereas, for inline box, the box will not break onto a new line. Moreover, the properties which all apply with block box will not apply with this sort of box. However, the margin, the padding and the border control the limitation if the elements which fit inside of the box but will not push away any elements.

            The difference between <b>display</b> values <b>inline</b>, <b>inline-block</b>, and <b>block</b>.
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>For display inline:</b> Inline elements don't start on a new line but they appear on the same line as the content. You can add width to the left and right on an inline elements, whereas you can't add height to top and bottom margin and padding of an inline element.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>For display inline-block:</b> Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, because they can padding and margins. However, they are really usefull for creating a horizontal navigation menu.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>For display block:</b> A block element always start on a new line and fills up the space left and right. The advantage of using block elements is you can add margin and padding on all four sides.
