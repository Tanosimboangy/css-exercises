      <ul>
        <li>
          Width
          <ul>
            <li>
              The default values for the width propertie is <b>auto</b>
            </li>
            <li>
              The default values for the height propertie is <b>auto</b>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Yes, these default values don't apply if the element is an inline-like element.
        </li>
        <li>
          They don't change if the element is an block-like element. But instead, the element will automatically apply its height and its width to allow its content to be displayed correctly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If a min-width value is greater than a width value, the min-width won't be applied.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If a max-width value is less than a width value the max-width will be applied.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If a min-width value is greater than a max-width value,
          the width of the container will be the largest value and the min-width value will be the one that's applied.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          When widths are applied to table cells, and the content inside these cells doesn't fit, the cells will be wide depending on the content inside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The deal with height and percentage values  is that the percentage is calculated according to the height of the generated box's containing block.
        </li>
        <li>
          The percent is the percent of height.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All the significant or interesting characteristics of this ruleset is:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The min-width has different value and different unit from the max-width.
            </li>
            <li>
              The max-width will be calculated by the releative to 1% of the width of the viewport, whereas the min-width will be calculated by the releative to font size of the root element.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The implied width of a div is that width's value will be calculated according to div's width because div element has a width of 500px, and margin set to auto.
        </li>
      </ul>
