            The default value for the property <b>Position</b> is <b>static\</b>.

            Some of the other propreties the user needs to supply when using any non-default position value are:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Width
              </li>
              <li>
                Top
              </li>
              <li>
                Right
              </li>
              <li>
                Bottom
              </li>
              <li>
                Left
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The inferred display value of an element that has been positioned is block.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            One of the non-default values for position still maintains a box in the flow of the document. It is the <b>relative</b> value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The special or significant about <b>Fixed</b> and <b>Sticky</b> positioning is that:
            <ul>
              <li>
                 They keep the element to stay on the same location even though the document is scrowlled up or down.
              </li>
              <li>
                They can stop the  viewport from changing when the window is scrolled, and <b>fixed</b> or <b>sticky</b> positioned element will be on the place where it is when the page is scrolled.
              </li>
              <li>
                However, they still allow us to scrowl the viewport without any difficulties.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When positioning an element absolutely, to lock that element's coordinates to its parent element we need to set a specific coordinates for its parents before setting up the coordinates for its children.
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolute positioned layouts are useful for:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Placing proprely any page element exactly where you want it to be.
              </li>
              <li>
                By using the positioning attributes top, left, bottom, and right the user can set the location perfectly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Controling the layout exactly as what you want it to be displayed.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sometimes if you put two absolutely positioned elements in the same physical space, they'll stack, i.e. only one will be visible on top:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The rules here are:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Two elements set absolutely on the same place, if they have the same size, the one which is set the first will occupy the place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Using the property z-index helps the user to position two or more elements on the same location, but they have different sizes.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                A certain element is on top because this is the first element that set the first.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can adjust that ourselves by using the property z-index, which sets the elements to appear on the same location according to their orders.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS's <b>Stacking Context</b> is an element that contains a set of layers.
          </li>
        </ul>
