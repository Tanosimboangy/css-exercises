        Grid is the most powerful and freshest layout technique in our tool-belt.<br>
        Some grid-like layouts are easily achieveable, but more complex layouts can be really tricky to implement.

    <main>
      <ul>
        <li>
          By default a GRID has one column.
        </li>
        <li>
          These are the difference between <b>Flexbox</b> and <b>Grid</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Flexbox</b> is created for layout in one dimension: row or column. Whereas, <b>Grid</b> is created for layout in both dimensions: row and column.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's true that we can wrap with both flexbox and grid, but there is a little difference between them. <b>For Flexbox</b>, the element will wrap depends on what happened on the first row, so all rows might not have the same ending row. <b>For Grid</b> as soon as the item can fill a row and it moves to the new row, so all rows must have the same ending row.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>For Flexbox</b> you need to define most of the layout on the children, but <b>for Grid</b> it only needs to happen on the parent element.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fnally, using <b>Grid</b> is better and easier to make the elements overlap. But for <b>Flexbox</b> it's a bit complicated to make the elements overlap for this reason you still need negative margins, transforms.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          I would use flexbox rather than grid because flexboxis the best for arranging elements in one dimension either row or column.<br>
          Moreover, flexbox is more supported by the browser then grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          I would use Grid rather than flexbox because it helps me to control the two dimensionc(rows, and columns) at the same time. Furthermore, using flexbox is more tricky using grid.
        </li>
        <li>
          A more concise way to write out the following: grid-template-columns: 10rem 10rem 10rem 10rem; is using repeat() function. By using this will help you to represent a repeated fragment of the track list.
        </li>
        <li>
          We can specify a minimum height for a grid row, but still allow the row to increase in height if its content is too tall by .
        </li>
      </ul>
