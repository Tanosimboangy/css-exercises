        Custom Properties

      <ul>
        <li>
          We have to use some characters when defining a Custom Property's name. Those are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Two dashes(--) preceded a selected name.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dashe(-) or underscore(_) if the name is more than two words.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Characters we can't use in a Custom Property name are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Period or fullstop.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The possible values we can assign to a new Custom Property are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Number
            </li>
            <li>
              Text
            </li>
            <li>
              Key words
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          It is useful to create Custom Properties using the :root or html selector when we want to avoid rewrite the same values every property. To be clear, the user can reduce the need of repetition. Furthermore, it can be applied across your HTML document. Using Custom Properties keeps you to risk for having an error.
          <ul>
            <li>
              It is not when we want to use the same variable custom property but has differnt values in each time.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          After we've defined a new Custom Property, we can recall or use that Custom Property. For that to happen, after we've set the selector, you have to specify your custom property name inside the var() function as a value of the property.
          <ul>
            <li>
              We can use var() function.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several ways to override or change a Custom Property. These are some of them:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Specify the selector and set the new custom property with the new selector and the new value for it. But it only works on div.
            </li>
            <li>
              We can change it directly.
            </li>
            <li>
              using @media
            </li>
            <li>
              Set the property under the last one.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Custom Properties are useful because they help the author to write less and clean but really powerful css. Moreover, they can help to avoid the repetition of some same values. One point of control.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only aspect (or part) of CSS syntax that we can use Custom Properties for is declaration block.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
