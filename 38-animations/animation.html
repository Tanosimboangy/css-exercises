          Keyframe Animation setup needs some unique code, it starts with the initial state you want it to.

        <li>
          What makes the keyframes code different to the rest of CSS is that you have to set <mark>@keyframes</mark> (at the beginning of the code) rule before setting up all animation properties, otherwise it's not going to work.
        </li>
        <li>
          To use a keyframe animation we set up earlier as a property in a ruleset for an element, we have to define a specific name for the @keyframes with its rule and need to call that name to link an animation to its keyframe declaration.

          Keyframe animations have other keywords that aren't available in transitions, what are these keywords?
        </li>
        <li>
          How many properties can we animate at once?

        </li>
