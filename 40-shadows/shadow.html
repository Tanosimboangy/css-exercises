          There are two types of shadows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Box Shadows, or the shadows that run around or inside a box.
          </li>
          <li>
            Text Shadwos, or the ghostly shadow outlines of text.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </header>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Box-shadow and text-shadow have very similar value syntax. However, they have some differences like:
          <ul>
            <li>
              We can use thickness value with box shadow but we can not use it with text shadow.
            </li>
            <li>
              We can not use inset value with the text shadow whereas we can use it with box shadow.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If I wanted to create a hard-edge shadow, one that looks like a solid border, the combination of values I would need to use is 0 for the X and 0 for Y but a value bigger than 0 for the thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Yes, it is possible to create a shadow on a circular element. We can create a shadow on a polygon, but with these conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>It can only work with SVG.</li>
            <li>Moreover, you have to use filter</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Yes, it is possible to create multiple shadows on the same element.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </main>
