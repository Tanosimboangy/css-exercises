      <h2>
        Pointer-events
      </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The pointer-events sets whether or not an element should react to pointer events. If the value for this is none the pointer will not work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Auto</b> is the default value for this property.

        <h2>
          Outline
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The outline property specifies the outline to be added to the box. This is useful if you want to  wrap an element but without setting a width for that element.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Medium invert color</b> is the default value for this property.
          </li>
          <li>
            This works quite similar to border but it is set on the border of the border.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are <ul>
              <li>outline-style(specifies the style of the outline)</li>
              <li>outline-color(specifies the color of the outline)</li>
              <li>outline-width(specifies the width of outline)</li>
              <li>outline-offset(adds space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.)</li>
              <li>outline(is a shorthand property)</li>

        <h2>
          Filter
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The CSS filters property are used to adjust the renderign of an image, a bacground, or a border.
          </li>
          <li>
            None is the default value for this property, so when the value is invalid, the value returns to none.
          </li>
          <li>
            By using this property, you can control how you want to render an image or background by using oone these values:
            <ol>
              <li>Blur (This applies a Gaussian blur to the input image).</li>
              <li>Brightness (This applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear more or less bright).</li>
              <li>Contrast (This adjusts the contrast of the input image).</li>
              <li>Drop-shadow (This applies a drop shadow effect to the input image).</li>
              <li>Grayscale (This will convert the input image to grayscale).</li>
              <li>Invert (This inverts the samples in the input image).</li>
              <li>Opacity (This applies transparency to the samples in the input image).</li>
              <li>Saturate (This saturates the input image).</li>
              <li>Sepia (This converts the input image to sepia).</li>
              <li>Brightness (This applies a linear multiplier to the input image, making it appear more or less bright).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Appearance
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The <b>appearance</b> property is used to display an element using a platform-native styling based on the users’ operating system’s theme. This is really useful if you want to override an object set by default.
          </li>
          <li>
            The <b>appearance</b> property is used for one of two reason: To apply and platform specific styling to an element that doesn’t have it by default. And To remove platform specific styling to an element that doesn’t have it by default.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            These are the values that we can use for this property: fill, contain, cover, none, scale-down.
          </li>
          <li>
            By using object-fit you can alter the alignment of the replaced element's content object within the element's box.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

          </li>
          <li>
            Note: This pseudo-class applies only to the focused element itself. Use :focus-within if you want to select an element that contains a focused element.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>

          <li>
            The :is() or :matches CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in that list. This is useful for writing large selectors in a more compact form.
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            The supports condition consists of one or more name-value pairs combined by conjunctions <mark>and</mark>, <mark>or</mark>, <mark>not</mark>.
          </li>
          <li>

          @media
        </h2>
        <ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            We have to deal with <mark>min-width</mark> and <mark>max-with</mark>.
